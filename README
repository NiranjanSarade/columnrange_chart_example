This is a sample example of Column range chart with Highcharts library. (http://www.highcharts.com)

We might have a business requirement to identify the overlap of the user requests along
the timeline of the application usage. The example provided has fake data. But data such as
request start time, duration, user and type of request can be recorded in some database table and in real case, the range [start time, end time] can be used while plotting the graph.
